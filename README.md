# Linear-Regression--2-continuous-variable
#### Introduction
In this activity, you will use simple linear regression to explore the relationship between two continuous variables. To accomplish this, you will perform a complete simple linear regression analysis, which includes creating and fitting a model, checking model assumptions, analyzing model performance, interpreting model coefficients, and communicating results to stakeholders.

For this activity, you are part of an analytics team that provides insights about marketing and sales. You have been assigned to a project that focuses on the use of influencer marketing, and you would like to explore the relationship between marketing promotional budgets and sales. The dataset provided includes information about marketing campaigns across TV, radio, and social media, as well as how much revenue in sales was generated from these campaigns. Based on this information, leaders in your company will make decisions about where to focus future marketing efforts, so it is critical to have a clear understanding of the relationship between the different types of marketing and the revenue they generate.

This activity will develop your knowledge of linear regression and your skills evaluating regression results which will help prepare you for modeling to provide business recommendations in the future
